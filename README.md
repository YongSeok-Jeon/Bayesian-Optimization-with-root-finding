# **Bayesian Optimization with Root-Finding (BOwRF)**

## Introduction
Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a prominent tool for finding the optimum of the expensive-to-evaluate function. In this repository, we provide a root-finding scheme adapted BO that is particularly useful when calibrating the virtual model (digital twin) to their real-world counterparts. Posted codes and figures are based on the paper that will be published in the Winter Simulation Conference (WSC 2024).
